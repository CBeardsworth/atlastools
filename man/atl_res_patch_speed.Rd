\usage{
atl_res_patch_speed(
  data,
  max_speed = 10,
  lim_spat_indep = 100,
  lim_time_indep = 30,
  min_fixes = 3,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe of values of any class that is or extends data.frame.
The dataframe must contain at least two spatial coordinates, \code{x} and
\code{y}, and a temporal coordinate, \code{time}. The names of columns
specifying these can be passed as arguments below. The column \code{id}
indicating animal id is \emph{required}.}

\item{max_speed}{A numeric value specifying the maximum speed (m/s) between two
coordinates that would be considered non-transitory}

\item{lim_spat_indep}{A numeric value of distance in metres of the spatial
distance between two patches for them to the considered independent.}

\item{lim_time_indep}{A numeric value of time in minutes of the time
difference between two patches for them to be considered independent.}

\item{min_fixes}{The minimum number of fixes for a group of
spatially-proximate number of ponts to be considered a preliminary residence
patch.}

\item{summary_variables}{Optional variables for which patch-wise summary
values are required. To be passed as a character vector.}

\item{summary_functions}{The functions with which to summarise the summary
variables; must return only a single value, such as median, mean etc. To be
passed as a character vector.}
}
\value{
A data.frame extension object. This dataframe has the added column
\code{patch} and \code{patchdata}, indicating the patch identity and the
data used to construct the patch. In addition, there are columns with patch
summary variables.
}
\description{
A cleaned movement track can be classified into residence patches using the
function \code{atl_res_patch}.
The function expects a specific organisation of the data: there should be
at least the following columns, \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{time}, and
\code{id}, all named in lower case, and corresponding to the coordinates,
timestamp in the UNIX format (seconds since 1970), and the identity of the
tracked individual.
The result contains only the data that was classified as a residence patch
and removes transit between them.
\code{atl_res_patch} requires only three parameters: (1) the distance
threshold between positions (called \code{buffer_size}), (2) the distance
threshold between clusters of positions (called \code{lim_spat_indep}),
and (3) the time interval between clusters (called \code{lim_time_indep}).
Clusters formed of fewer than a minimum number of positions can be excluded.
The exclusion of clusters with few positions can help in removing bias due to
short stops, but if such short stops are also of interest, they can be
included by reducing the \code{min_fixes} argument.
Position covariates such as speed may also be summarised patch-wise by
passing covariate names and  summary functions as character vectors to the
\code{summary_variables} and \code{summary_functions} arguments, respectively
.
